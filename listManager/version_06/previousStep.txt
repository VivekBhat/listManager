1. Inject localstorage into your controller 
2. Create a saveList Function that sets $localStorage.currentList = vm.currentList
	a. Call the Save Function wherever changes are made to the list or items
	b. Make sure the save occurs after other actions are complete
3. Check to see if currentList exists on $localStorage 
	a. If it does set vm.currentList to $localStorage.currentList
	b. If it does NOT set vm.currentList to a new List
	c. Test this by creating a list and then refreshing the page (your list should remain)
4. Great! Just one small issue our prototype functions no longer work? Why is this?
	a. $localStorage just stores the JSON and is not the object we need to update our constructors for List and ListItem
	b. Hint pass a data object to the constructors and check for properties
	c. You will also need to update the List.addItem function
5. We need to create 3 function stubs for the following functions. We will do this on the view model
	a. addList
	b. nextList
	c. prevList
	d. set the buttons on the template accordingle so that clicking the buttons will fire the functions
